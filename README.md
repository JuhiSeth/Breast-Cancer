Cancer  is  now  a  day's  one  of  the  main  diseases which   has  widely  affected  among  the  peoples.   A  molecular pathologist  selects  a  list  of  genetic  variations  of  interest  that he/she wants to analyze. The molecular pathologist searches for evidence in the medical literature that somehow is relevant to the genetic  variations  of  interest  Finally  this  molecular  pathologist spends  a  huge  amount  of  time  detecting  the  evidence  which  is related  to  each  of  the  variations  to  classify  them.  The  ultimate goal  is  to  replace  step  3  by  a  machine  learning  model.  The molecular  pathologist  will  still  have  to  decide  which  variations area  of  interest,  and  also  collect  the  relevant  evidence.  In  this paper,  we  apply  machine  learning  methods  especially  logistic regression (which is more accurate) on the datasets to determine and  examine  whether  there are  any  signs  or  possibilities  of cancer and if the person is examined as cancerous then the stage of  cancer  is  also  determined.  Cancer  disease  is  classified  into four  types  named  type  1,  type  2,  type  3  and  type  4.  Id,  Gene, variation, and class are the fields used.
